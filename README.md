# Data-Engineering-Project1
The project refers to an Online Transaction Database (OLTP) for a fictitious manufacturing company
Cataschevastica. This database serves as the central repository for managing the end-to-end
manufacturing process, from order intake, items production to delivery, while prioritising customer
satisfaction, operational efficiency, and service quality.
The trainees will be given a detailed description of the business needs to analyse, design, implement,
populate data, and perform transactions and analytic queries on this OLTP database. The
implementation will take place firstly at the local development environment and then it will be
migrated to Azure Cloud
